# C++ 20 `<=>` Tutorial

This repository contains example codes discussed in the video tutorial on mastering C++ 20 and the powerful `<=>` operator.

## How to Compile

We use CMake for compiling the examples. Follow these steps to compile and run the examples:

1. Make sure you have CMake installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the example you want to compile.

3. Create a build directory:

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

4. Generate the build files with CMake:

```
cmake ..
```

5. Build the project:

```
cmake --build .
```

6. Execute the unit tests:

```
ctest -V
```
